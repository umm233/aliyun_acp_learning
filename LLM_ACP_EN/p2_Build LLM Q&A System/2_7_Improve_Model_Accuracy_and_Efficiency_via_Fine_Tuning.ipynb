    "## 🚄 Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons, we introduced how to build a Q&A bot and attempted to enhance its capabilities by optimizing prompt, constructing RAG chatbot, and extending plugins. However, you may have noticed that you've been \"patching\" around the model—that is, these methods essentially enhance the model's performance through external tools, while the model's inherent knowledge boundaries and reasoning abilities remain fundamentally unchanged. This section will take you into the \"training ground\" of LLMs, directly improving the model’s underlying capabilities through fine-tuning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "When facing in-depth needs in specific domains, such as precise parsing of elementary school math problems, relying on prompt engineering and RAG chatbot often falls short. For details like operator precedence rules or unit conversion logic in word problems, the model needs to establish a structured knowledge system. This is where fine-tuning shows its unique advantages: by \"targeted feeding\" the model with math problem-solving examples generated by DeepSeek-R2, you can enable the model to learn DeepSeek-R2's knowledge in mathematics, grasp mathematical thinking paradigms, and even independently discover problem-solving patterns.\n"

    "## 2. Fine-tuning principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 How models learn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Machine learning - finding patterns through data\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional programming , you usually know the explicit rules, and write these rules into functions. For example: $f(x) = ax$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $a$ is a known deterministic value (also called a parameter or weight). This function represents a simple algorithmic model that can compute (predict) the output $y$ based on the input $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real-world scenarios, it's more likely that you don't know the explicit rules (parameters) beforehand, but you may have some observed phenomena (data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of machine learning is to help you use this data (training set) to try and find (learn) these parameter values, a process known as training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 loss function & Cost function - quantifying model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the most suitable parameters, you need a way to measure whether the currently tested parameters are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you now need to evaluate whether the parameter $a$ in the model $f(x) = ax$ is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assess the model's performance on a single data point $x_i, y_i$ by subtracting the predicted result $f(x_i)$ from the actual result $y_i$ for each sample $x_i$ in the training set. The function used to evaluate this error is called the loss function (or error function): $L(y_i, f(x_i)) = y_i - ax_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the difference might yield positive or negative values, which could cancel each other out when aggregating losses, underestimating the total loss. To address this issue, you can consider squaring the difference as the loss: $L(y_i, f(x_i)) = (y_i - ax_i)^2$. Additionally, squaring amplifies the impact of errors, helping you identify the most suitable model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In practical applications, models may use different calculation methods as the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the model's overall performance across the entire training set, you can calculate the average loss of all samples (that i, the mean squared error). This function, used to assess the model's overall performance across all training samples, is called the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a training set with m samples, the cost function can be expressed as: $J(a) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - ax_i)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In practical applications, different models may also choose different calculation methods as the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the cost function, the task of finding suitable model parameters can be equated to finding the minimum value of the cost function (i.e., the optimal solution). Finding the minimum value of the cost function means that the corresponding parameter a value is the most suitable model parameter value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plot the cost function, the task of finding the optimal solution essentially involves finding the lowest point on the curve or surface.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN0149XTTS1WUKSTtpeoh_!!6000000002791-2-tps-2314-1682.png\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> In real-world projects, people often interchangeably use the terms cost function and loss function. In subsequent content and code, we will follow this engineering convention and refer to the cost function as the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 Gradient descent algorithm - automatically determining the optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous curve, you can visually identify the lowest point. However, in practical applications, models typically have many parameters, and their lost functions are often complex surfaces in high-dimensional spaces, making it virtually impossible to find the optimal solution through direct observation. You need an automated method to find the optimal parameter configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is one of the most common methods for this. A typical implementation of gradient descent starts by randomly selecting a starting point on the surface (or curve), then continuously making small adjustments to the parameters until finding the lowest point (corresponding to the optimal parameter configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01ihhR9Y1IbkFZTQ3bV_!!6000000000912-1-tps-1080-810.gif\" style=\"width: 400px;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a model, you need the training program to automatically adjust the parameters so that the value of the loss function approaches the lowest point. Therefore, the gradient descent algorithm must automatically control two aspects: the direction and the magnitude of parameter adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Direction of parameter adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "If the loss function is a U-shaped curve, you can intuitively see that the parameter adjustment should move in the direction where the absolute value of the slope decreases, that is, towards a flatter area.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01ME3u6G203FVsQsmLe_!!6000000006793-2-tps-1608-1244.png\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the loss function is a surface in a three-dimensional coordinate system, the direction of parameter adjustment should similarly move towards a flatter area. However, at a certain point on the surface, there are multiple possible descending directions. To find the lowest point as quickly as possible, you should move in the steepest direction.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01Uh8OxI1mqnkBHqMjH_!!6000000005006-1-tps-664-684.gif\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent from a point on the surface, and its opposite direction is the steepest descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the lowest point on the surface in the shortest time, the direction of parameter adjustment should be along the opposite direction of the gradient, denoted by the green arrow direction in the two figures above.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a curve f(a) in a two-dimensional coordinate system, the gradient at a point is the slope at that point. \n",
    "> For a surface f(a,b) in a three-dimensional coordinate system, the gradient at a point is a two-dimensional vector composed of the slope values in the a and b axis directions. This indicates the rate of change of the function in each input variable direction and points in the direction of the fastest growth. Calculating the slope of a point on the surface in a particular axis direction is also referred to as taking the partial derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Magnitude of parameter adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "After determining the direction of parameter adjustment, we need to determine the magnitude of the adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting parameters with a fixed step size is the easiest approach, but this may prevent you from ever finding the lowest point, instead causing oscillation near the lowest point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, adjusting parameters with a fixed step size of 1.5 results in oscillation around the lowest value, but it's unable to reach the lowest point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01y7FatQ27bKI9CYCJ1_!!6000000007815-1-tps-938-646.gif\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this issue, the adjustment magnitude should be reduced as you approach the lowest point. The closer you get to it, the smaller the slope should become. Instead of using a fixed step size, you can use the slope at the current position as the adjustment magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01h45Ifb1xRZhXXIXEC_!!6000000006440-1-tps-892-618.gif\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some loss function curves are very steep, and simply using the slope may still cause oscillation around the lowest point. To address this, multiply the slope by a coefficient to regulate the step size. This coefficient is called the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of learning rate is particularly important for training effectiveness and efficiency:\n",

    "A smaller learning rate, although more computationally expensive and time-consuming, enables the optimization process to converge more precisely toward the minimum of the cost function. In practical model training , dynamic adjustment of the learning rate is commonly employed to balance convergence speed and accuracy. For example,  Model Studio's model fine-tuning feature includes built-in [learning rate adjustment strategy](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/user-guide/using-fine-tuning-on-console#7864d6a606ztg), allowing users to configure linear or curve-based decay. Alibaba Cloud's PAI also provides an [AutoML](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/automl/) tool that can automatically search for an optimal learning rate, reducing manual tuning effort and improving training efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.4 More parameters used in model training engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Batch size\n",
    "\n",
    "During the optimization process, each iteration—comprising gradient computation and parameter update—is referred to as a training step .\n",
    "\n",
    "In basic gradient descent, the gradient is computed using a single data point or the entire dataset. However, in practice, we typically use mini-batch gradient descent , where the batch size n determines how many samples are used per step. The gradients from these n samples are averaged before updating the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A larger batch size accelerates training by leveraging parallel computing capabilities and stabilizing gradient estimates, but it requires more memory and computational resources.\n",
    "* However, an excessively large batch size may lead to poorer generalization due to reduced stochasticity and sharper minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting an appropriate batch size involves balancing hardware constraints, training speed, and model performance. In practice, empirical experimentation is often necessary to identify the optimal batch size for a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluation steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the large size of most training datasets, it is inefficient to evaluate the model on the validation set after every full pass through the data. Instead, evaluation is typically performed at regular intervals during training—specifically, after every fixed number of training steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interval is controlled by the `eval_steps` parameter. For instance, setting `eval_steps=500` means the model will be evaluated on the validation set every 500 training steps. This approach allows for timely monitoring of model performance without significantly slowing down training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "One complete pass through the entire training dataset is defined as an epoch. Since a single epoch is rarely sufficient to reach the optimal solution (that is, the minimum of the loss function), most training frameworks allow configuration of the total number of epochs—for example, via the `num_train_epochs` parameter in the Swift training framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Too few epochs may result in underfitting, where the model fails to learn the underlying patterns.\n",
    "* Too many epochs can lead to overfitting, extended training times, and unnecessary resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely adopted strategy to determine the ideal stopping point is early stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than fixing the number of epochs in advance, training continues until model performance on the validation set plateaus or begins to degrade.\n",
    "* This method helps prevent overfitting and improves efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "While early stopping is effective, it is not the only approach. Other techniques include adaptive learning rate scheduling based on validation loss trends, which indirectly influences the effective number of training epochs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Challenges in machine learning**\n",

    "* **Pre-training**: Training the model on a large-scale **general dataset** so that it can learn broad foundational knowledge or feature representations. This knowledge is usually general and not aimed at any specific task. Pre-training is not task-specific, but provides a powerful initial model for various downstream tasks. Typical pre-trained models: Qwen2.5-Max, DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4.\n",
    "* **Fine-tuning**: Further training the model using a **small-scale dataset** specific to a task based on the pre-trained model. The goal is to make the model adapt to specific downstream tasks (such as medical, legal, and other professional domain needs).\n",

    "It is worth mentioning that **pre-training generally learns through self-supervised learning**, with data coming from massive texts available on the internet (including Wikipedia, books, and web pages), allowing the model to find patterns or \"guess \" on its own. This learning method does not require manual annotation, saving much labor costs, making it naturally suitable for learning from massive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **fine-tuning is done through supervised learning**, requiring small-scale annotated data for specific tasks (such as annotated reviews for sentiment classification, or annotated medical texts), and directly teaching the model to complete tasks using annotated data. Due to the high cost of manual annotation, this learning method is difficult to scale to massive data, thus making it more suitable for model training with clear scenario goals, typically requiring only a few thousand to tens of thousands of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you can quickly and cost-effectively build your LLM application as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Choose a pre-trained model (Qwen, DeepSeek, GPT). This can save the comprehensive cost of training a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Fine-tune the model according to your actual scenario, usually only needing to build a few thousand annotated data applicable to the actual scenario, because the total number of training tokens is greatly reduced. This effectively shortens the training time, thereby further reducing the training cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning can shorten training time, but can fine-tuning the model also reduce memory requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of model parameters is the main factor affecting memory requirements. From the perspective of adjusting the size of the parameter count, fine-tuning can be divided into **full-parameter** and **parameter-efficient fine-tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full-parameter fine-tuning**, also known as **full fine-tuning**, is an optimization approach that updates all parameters of a pre-trained model during adaptation to a downstream task. In this method, every layer and weight in the model architecture is trainable and can be adjusted based on task-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy offers two key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It avoids the prohibitive cost of training a model from scratch by leveraging powerful pre-trained representations.\n",
    "* It ensures no part of the model is frozen, reducing the risk of performance degradation due to under-adapted components.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite its effectiveness, full fine-tuning remains computationally expensive , especially for large-scale models. It demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Significant GPU memory (for storing gradients and optimizer states),\n",
    "* High-throughput hardware,\n",
    "* Long training times,\n",
    "* Large volumes of high-quality labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, while full fine-tuning often achieves strong performance, it is not always practical—particularly in resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "To address these challenges, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods have emerged as a powerful alternative. PEFT techniques adapt large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, while keeping the majority of the original model weights frozen. Remarkably, they achieve performance close to full fine-tuning—with drastically reduced computational and storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular PEFT methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adapter Tuning: Inserts small neural network modules (\"adapters\") between transformer layers.\n",
    "* Prompt Tuning: Learns task-specific soft prompts (continuous embeddings) while freezing the model.\n",
    "* LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): A leading method that approximates weight changes using low-rank matrices—requiring only 0.1% to 1% of the original model’s parameters to be trained.\n",

    "## ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we have learned the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding the core value of model fine-tuning: By injecting task-specific data (such as math problem solutions), fine-tuning directly enhances the model’s reasoning ability in targeted domains, overcoming the limitations of prompt engineering and RAG-based chatbots.\n",
    "* Mastering key training parameters:\n",
    "    * Learning rate controls the step size of parameter updates.\n",
    "    * Epoch determines how many times the model iterates over the entire dataset.\n",
    "    * Batch size affects gradient stability and memory usage.\n",
    "* The loss function provides feedback on training progress by measuring prediction error.\n",
    "* Understanding the principle of LoRA efficient fine-tuning: LoRA reduces memory and computational costs through low-rank matrix decomposition—updating only small auxiliary matrices instead of all model parameters. In practice, adjusting the lora_rank parameter allows trade-offs between model capacity and training efficiency.\n",
    "* Completing iterative hyperparameter tuning experiments: Through multiple rounds of adjustment—such as modifying learning rate, data volume, and number of training epochs—we addressed underfitting and overfitting, ultimately achieving a significant improvement in the model’s problem-solving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this tutorial allows you to use prepared datasets and experience fine-tuning with free GPU resources, in real-world production scenarios, fine-tuning is not straightforward. It requires careful consideration of factors such as computational costs, data scale, and data quality. In particular, pay attention to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assess whether simpler, lower-cost methods—like prompt engineering or RAG chatbots—are sufficient for the task before proceeding to fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. Ensure that the amount and quality of labeled data meet the minimum threshold—typically at least 1,000 high-quality, task-relevant samples—to achieve meaningful improvements.\n",
    "3. Verify that the project budget aligns with required expertise and infrastructure, ensuring acceptable cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further learning\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning for more machine learning tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image Classification\n",
    "    * *Examples*: object recognition, medical image diagnosis\n",
    "    * *Purpose*: Adapt pre-trained models (examples: ResNet, ViT) to extract features specific to a new image dataset.\n",
    "    * *Key points*: Leverage general visual knowledge from pre-training; reduce data requirements through transfer learning.\n",
    "* Object Detection\n",
    "    * *Examples*: autonomous driving, security monitoring\n",
    "    * Purpose: Fine-tune models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN to detect specific objects or scenes.\n",
    "    * *Key points*: Improve sensitivity to target categories and locations, reducing false alarms and missed detections.\n",
    "* Machine Translation \n",
    "    * *Examples*: domain-specific translation, customer support localization\n",
    "    * *Purpose*: Adapt general-purpose translation models (such as mBART or T5) to professional terminology and stylistic conventions.\n",
    "    * *Key points*: Correct semantic biases that arise when general models are applied to specialized domains.\n",
    "* Recommendation Systems\n",
    "    * *Examples*: e-commerce, content platforms\n",
    "    * *Purpose*: Optimize recommendation models (such as collaborative filtering or deep ranking models) using user behavior data.\n",
    "    * *Key points*: Balance personalization with cold-start challenges to improve click-through and conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More efficient fine-tuning methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Freeze**: One of the earliest PEFT methods. Most of the model’s parameters are frozen during training, and only a small portion—such as the final layers—are updated.\n",
    "    Characteristics:\n",
    "        * High parameter efficiency (only a small number of parameters are trained).\n",
    "        * Effective when the downstream task is similar to the pre-training objective (such as text classification).\n",
    "        * May underperform on complex or highly divergent tasks due to limited adaptability.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01X9GOk81sgAEtxflGR_!!6000000005795-2-tps-1340-686.png\" style=\"width: 600px;display: block; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adapter Tuning**: Small neural network modules called adapter layers are inserted at specific positions within the original model architecture (such as between transformer layers). During fine-tuning, the original model parameters are frozen—only the Adapter layers are trained. \n",
    "    Characteristics:\n",
    "        * Modular design with strong compatibility across tasks.\n",
    "        * Slightly higher number of trainable parameters compared to LoRA, but delivers stable performance.\n",
    "        * Requires structural modifications to the model, and introduces additional computational overhead during inference due to the extra layers.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN016gccCd1CdDpjDxbe9_!!6000000000103-2-tps-1482-1048.png\" style=\"width: 500px;display: block; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: auto\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt Tuning: Indirectly control model behavior by introducing learnable input vectors (called prompts) during training. The original model parameters are frozen, and only these prompt embeddings are updated. \n",
    "    Characteristics:\n",
    "        * No need to modify the model architecture—only the input representation is adjusted.\n",
    "        * Well-suited for generative tasks such as translation, dialog generation, and summarization.\n",
    "        * Performance depends heavily on prompt design; may underperform on complex or highly structured tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning dataset construction strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for more complex scenarios, effective fine-tuning requires at least **1,000+ high-quality training dataset samples**. When building your dataset, confirm the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Quality**: Ensure the dataset is accurate, relevant, and free of ambiguity or errors. Remove noisy or incorrect entries that could mislead training.\n",
    "* **Diversity Coverage**: Include a wide range of scenarios, contexts, and domain-specific terminology to prevent the model from overfitting to a narrow data distribution.\n",
    "* **Class Balance**: For classification tasks with multiple categories, ensure balanced representation across classes to avoid bias toward dominant ones.\n",
    "* **Continuous Iteration**: Fine-tuning is an iterative process. Continuously optimize and expand the dataset based on the model's performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you lack sufficient labeled data , consider enhancing the model’s knowledge using retrieval-augmented approaches, such as querying a knowledge base (business documents, FAQs).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In many real-world business scenarios, combining model fine-tuning with knowledge base retrieval yields better results than either method alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the following strategies to expand the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Manual Annotation**: Domain experts label or enrich data for critical or representative scenarios.\n",
    "* **Model Generation**: Use LLMs to generate synthetic data that mimics real-world usage.\n",
    "* **External Collection**: Gather data from public datasets, web scraping, user interactions, or customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common evaluation metrics for models\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics differ significantly depending on the task type. Below are some widely used metrics for common AI tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification tasks**:\n",
    "    * Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions.\n",
    "    * Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Especially useful in binary or multi-class classification to evaluate how well the model identifies positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text generation tasks**:\n",
    "    * BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation; computes scores based on n-gram overlaps between generated text and reference translation.\n",
    "    * ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Often used for summarization; measures recall of n-grams , precision, and F-measure.\n",
    "    * Perplexity: Evaluates how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image recognition/Object detection**:\n",
    "    * Intersection over union (IoU): Measures the overlap between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes. A higher IoU indicates better localization accuracy.\n",
    "    * mAP (mean average precision): A standard metric in object detection that averages precision across different classes and confidence thresholds.."
